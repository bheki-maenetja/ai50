# CS50 AI - Project 5 (Traffic)

### Development Process
For the development of the neural network I used the examples in src5 as a 'template'. From there, I experimented with the activation functions of the convolutional and hidden layers. I found that the different combinations of activation functions would drastically affect the performance of the model. After much experimentation I settled on the 'softsign' function for the convolution layers and the 'sigmoid' function for the hidden and output layers. Following this, I then experimented with the number of convolutional and hidden layers. I found that having two of each type was optimal for the performance of the model. Additionally, after each convolution layer I added pooling layers - an average pooling layer after the first convolutional layer and a max pooling layer after the second. I also added dropout layers between the hidden layers. After this, all that was left was to play around with the other parameters of the convolutional layers (number of filters, kernal size etc.) and hidden layers (number of units) before finding a suitable combination of accuracy and runtime performance.
